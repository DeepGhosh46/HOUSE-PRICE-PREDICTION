## 🔄 Workflow
### 1. **Data Collection**
- **Dataset**: [Boston Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#boston-dataset)
- The dataset includes diverse features such as:
  - `CRIM`: Per capita crime rate by town.
  - `RM`: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
  - `LSTAT`: % lower status of the population.
  - `PTRATIO`: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
  - ...and more.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing or null values to ensure data integrity.
- Normalizing numerical features for consistent scaling.
- Splitting the data into **training** (80%) and **testing** (20%) subsets.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualizing correlations between features using heatmaps and scatter plots.
- Identifying trends and anomalies in the data, such as outliers or skewed distributions.

### 4. **Feature Selection**
- Computing correlation matrices to rank feature importance.
- Selecting features that significantly contribute to house price prediction.

### 5. **Model Building**
- Training and evaluating multiple regression algorithms, including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
- Performance metrics:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **R² Score**
- Employing cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness and avoid overfitting.

## 📊 Results
- The **Gradient Boosting Regressor** emerged as the best-performing model:
  - **R² Score**:  0.88667 (on testing data)
  - **R² Score**:  0.999998 (on training data)
- Key insights:
  - `RM` (number of rooms) and `LSTAT` (% lower status of the population) were identified as the most influential features for predicting house prices.

## 🛠️ Challenges Faced
- Addressing multicollinearity among features to improve model stability.
- Overcoming outliers that skewed predictions.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Feature Enrichment**: Incorporating additional features like proximity to schools, transport options, and crime rates.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying the trained model as a web application for real-time price prediction.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Exploring deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, for enhanced predictive accuracy.
